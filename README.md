# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Model
This repository contains a machine learning model for sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The model is trained to analyze the sentiment (positive or negative) of tweets.

## Overview
Twitter sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion, tracking brand perception, and analyzing trends on social media. This model utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify the sentiment of tweets.

## Features
* Sentiment Classification: The model classifies tweets into two categories: positive or negative sentiment.
* Data Preprocessing: Preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, stemming, and TF-IDF vectorization are applied to the text data.
* Machine Learning: The model is trained using a supervised learning approach, with various algorithms such as logistic regression.
* Twitter API Integration: Optionally, the model can be integrated with the Twitter API to fetch real-time tweets for sentiment analysis.

## Usage
To use the Twitter sentiment analysis model:

* Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone.
* Install Dependencies: Install the necessary Python libraries listed in the requirements.txt file using pip install -r requirements.txt.
* Load the Model: Load the trained model and any required preprocessing components using Python's pickle or joblib libraries.
* Input Data: Provide tweet text or tweet IDs as input to the model for sentiment analysis.
* Get Results: Obtain the sentiment predictions (positive, negative, or neutral) for the input tweets.
